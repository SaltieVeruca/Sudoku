# Overview

The short term goal for this project is to design a Sudoku puzzle solver with no backtracking that mimics human strategies/techniques. Being aware of poor efficiency is a concern, but secondary to focusing on overall pattern readability (initially).

## Stages:

1. ~~Design initial pattern and implement basic solving (should be capable of solving beginner puzzle)~~
2. Implement more complex techniques (all known/practiced ones) and attempt to solve entire sample dataset
3. Attempt to find puzzles that cannot be solved by techniques (if initial sample was not sufficient)
4. Categorize techniques into difficulties and use them to rank puzzles
5. Use solver to power Sudoku puzzle generator with option for chosen difficulty
